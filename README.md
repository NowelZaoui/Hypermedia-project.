# Project analysis:

## Target user profile:
As it is to present a CV, the design is directed to be presented to the correspondent to look at the CVs for the jobs, either the owner or the person in charge for it.

## Information architecture
As it is a CV, the idea is to introduce yourself and give all the basic necessary information that can be offered.
I decided that the most important information would be four sections: **Profile**, **Academic**, **Languages** and **Experiencie**.
### Profile
Here it is divided into four sections: full name, residence address, contact information (phone and email) and personal data (date of birth and ID).
Here is all the information that is dedicated to the identification of the person, accompanied by a profile image.
### Academic
Here are all the titles that you have obtained or are studying to obtain. Each one of the titles is identified with the name of the title, the study center where it was studied and the year it was obtained (marking in process if you are still studying to obtain it).
### Languages
Here are the languages with which one has capacity.
Each language is presented with three sections, indicating behind them how much is the level with which it is mastered: Understanding (as is the level in case they are directed in this language, either speaking or by text), Writing (as is the level when it comes to being able to write in that language), and Speaker (how is the level of being able to speak in that language).
### Experiencie
Aqu√≠ se presenta una lista de los trabajos previos la persona ha trabajado.
