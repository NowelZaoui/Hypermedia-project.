# Project analysis:

## Target user profile:
As it is to present a CV, the design is directed to be presented to the correspondent to look at the CVs for the jobs, either the owner or the person in charge for it.

## Information architecture
As it is a CV, the idea is to introduce yourself and give all the basic necessary information that can be offered.
I decided that the most important information would be four sections: **Profile**, **Academic**, **Languages** and **Experiencie**.

### Profile
Here it is divided into four sections: full name, residence address, contact information (phone and email) and personal data (date of birth and ID).
Here is all the information that is dedicated to the identification of the person, accompanied by a profile image.

### Academic
Here are all the titles that you have obtained or are studying to obtain. Each one of the titles is identified with the name of the title, the study center where it was studied and the year it was obtained (marking in process if you are still studying to obtain it).

### Languages
Here are the languages with which one has capacity.

Each language is presented with three sections, indicating behind them how much is the level with which it is mastered: Understanding (as is the level in case they are directed in this language, either speaking or by text), Writing (as is the level when it comes to being able to write in that language), and Speaker (how is the level of being able to speak in that language).

### Experiencie
Here is a list of previous jobs the person has worked.

## Visual design
For the design, I chose to use an alternation of blue and green colors, in soft tones so that the design does not look too busy.

One of the things I wanted to put so that a browser appeared to be able to quickly go to one of the four sections in particular. I made that in case of passing the mouse over, there would be a change of color to highlight more the one that was wanted to be selected.

I also made each section have a different color, to be able to see what part of the page is dedicated to this section.

Since the background colors could make it difficult to read the text, I made the text white, except in the Profile section, as I wanted to emphasize that this section, where there is data about the person, is different from the rest since it is the information with which they can later contact that person if they wish.

## EXTRA
Since anything can be added in the Experience section, because the important thing for this practice was to do the HTML and CSS, what I have added are "works" that refer to video games, movies, books... to popular culture. One way to know what they refer to is that in the HTML you can see an identifier and there is the name of the source of the reference.

The reason for this, beyond because I like the idea of putting references, is because I wanted to make a list long enough so that the browser, when clicking on the section you want to view, scrolls the screen enough to put directly as desired, since if there is not much space, it may seem that it is not working well.

Another thing I wanted to do was that if you hover the mouse over one of the experiences, a text would appear next to the mouse indicating what it was referring to, but since I couldn't make a Javascript function that would do it in a generic way, I discarded the idea. The identifiers are a vestige of that idea, and at least they serve to be able to discover the source material.
